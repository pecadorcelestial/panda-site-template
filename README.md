# panda-site-template

A _"basic"_ template to start and run a site using **NodeJS**, **React**, **Router**, **Redux**, **Styled-Components** and **Webpack**.

## Start Up

First, you'll need to install all dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

## Development

To execute the site using a ``development`` environment run the following command:

```
npm run start:dev
```
This uses the advantages of the [_hot reloading_](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/) of Webpack, it will not create any bundle files and will keep the changes on real time.

## Production

The create the corresponding bundles, just run the webpack command and then start up the proyect:

```
npm run webpack
```
```
npm start
```
